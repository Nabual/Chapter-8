# Chapter-8: Creating an Appâ€™s Navigation
### What I Learned
I learned how to implement navigation using the Navigator class and routes. This included using named routes for a clean, scalable structure and anonymous routes for simpler transitions. I also practiced passing data between screens and managing navigation stacks.

### Achievement
I built a multi-page app with seamless navigation, effectively using both named and anonymous routes to guide users through the app.
